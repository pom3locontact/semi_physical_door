# 🚪Imersive Door Demo!
Godot: 4.3.stable
License: Currently NON, if You wish to use this project
as an inspiration and fundamation for Your's, hit me up.
And I'll grand You it no worries, BUT only if You are
**Independet Indie Team and Not Using It For AI Training**
Quick Descreption: Recreation of VR-Style Physical Doors in the GODOT Engine for non-vr games. 

> This is only a demo, it's not perfect or usable for production-ready products by any means. Its an form of template/inspiration. These door aren't a Physcial Object, rotated by math, not transfered movment source from Player's Velocity. High Customization. Semi-Open Source.



### 📽️ Demo presentation:
Will be here, still editing it...



### ⚙️ Highly Customizable:
Customize Your door how ever You like!
You can **mix and match** all of the settings,
to create the door that suit Your indie-needs.

### 🔊 Primitive Sound Simulation:
⚠️ WARNING: Semi-Working, still needs to be polished.
If we go with an realistic, imversive door,
we can't cheap out on the sound's. Its half
of the effect! Especially if YOU are creating
an **HORROR GAME!**

That's why I added an primitvie sound system.
If You wish to make it more addvanced, I recomend
using a third party librarys like FMOD. If You don't,
and mennage to improve it, fell free to **contribiute** ❤️

Potential steps to improve the sound simulation:
- Add more audio tracks, to simulate also the wood tork.
- Add an slight quick creek at the start of the door movment,
which will need an extra system for door speed range detection
to play coresponding sounds.
- Creativity, all usecases are diffrent. Feel free to
modify it and build on top of it **if** permision is granted.



### 🦾 IK Hand:
Due to the version on which this demo was developed on - 4.3
The Godot IK systems are not as advanced as in the newer engine versions.
You can easly limit the hinges of hand rotation bones, to prevent
any hand-visual related bugs.



### Math behind it:
Nothing to crazy, godot has build-in implementation
of dot products, lerping, IK, all build-in.
This dosen't mean that we shouldn't learn it,
and just integrate to our project. To actually
use it properly, there are some math topics you need to learn,
to use this demo to its full potential:
- vector projection formula / DOT product
- vectors
